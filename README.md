# Bayesian Deep Learning for Capillary Micromechanics

## Abstract
Capillary Micromechanics is an experimental technique used to
obtain material properties of a soft deformable microscopic object. 
This approach intends to replace traditional hand-crafted approaches to 
image segmentation and data post-processing with a machine learning model.
